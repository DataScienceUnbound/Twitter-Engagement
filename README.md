# Twitter-Engagement
In an opportunity from General Assembly and Track Maven, we gather data-driven insights to help brands drive Twitter Engagement. #groupproject

This is a github repo of my contributions to a group project.

My contributions include:
- Using AWS Rekognition to turn our image data into text data
- Exploring how the addition of image data affected the model constructed by Dale and Diego
- Performing Latent Dirichlet Analysis on the image data to break the images into topic categories
- Creating Decision Trees for each brand - to provide a tool for users to apply human judgement and our data insights to their content creation
